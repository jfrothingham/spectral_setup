# spectral_setup

Personal project to visualize spectral window selection. Plot receiver ranges, spectral windows, and spectral lines on their own or as annotations to an existing spectral visualization.

Written and tested with the Green Bank Telescope (GBT) in mind, but intended to be generalizable. 

Plan to also incorporate validation of mode selection for the GBT's spectral line backend, VEGAS.
